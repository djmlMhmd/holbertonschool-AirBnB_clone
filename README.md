# :mortar_board: AirBNB Clone Project

A first full Web Application group project at Holberton School. The goal of the project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

## Description :scroll:
The learning aims of this project is to consolidate our knowledge and skills in Python and OOP, to learn HTML/CSS, database storage, API, front-end integration and networking basics.

This project doesn' implement all the AirBNB features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

## Web Application Components: :gear:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging). Allows to:
	- create your data model
	- manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
	- store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
	- Static:
		- learn HTML/CSS
		- create the HTML of our application
		- create template of each object
	- Dynamic:
		- learn JQuery
		- load objects from the client side by using your own RESTful API
- A database (MySQL) or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API (RESTful API) that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
